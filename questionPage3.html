			<h2 class="question" id="question">The other team setter jumped just before  he was going to set like he was going to pass the ball to our side( second touch) . What should you do?  </h2>
			
			<h2 class="explanation" id="explanation">If you notice in the picture there are already three players on the front court side (3 attackers) which means the setter's starting position is at the backcourt , which also means that he can’t pass it to the other side on the second touch if he is on the frontcourt. So there is no need to block him .</h2>
