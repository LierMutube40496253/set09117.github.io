		<summary class="explanation">
			<p>
			The quiz is going to recreate a volleyball game. You will become a player within a
			team, which is playing against another team. Every time a question is answered correctly
			your team will sum up a point, otherwise the other team will. The first team to get to 15
			points wins.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Some of the questions will place you in a volleyball situation. This type of question will also be supported with an upper view of the
			court, which will include your position (in red) and the one of all the players on court. 
			
			Other question will focus on game rules and general knowledge of it.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			There will be four different answers. The user will have to choose the correct one in a limited amount of time, depending on the complexity of the question the time will vary.
			Once the question is answered the correct answer will be highlighted, and an explanation of why that is the correct answer will be shown.
			All explanations are really important, as they will give hints for other questions to be answered correctly and will help understanding how the sport works.
